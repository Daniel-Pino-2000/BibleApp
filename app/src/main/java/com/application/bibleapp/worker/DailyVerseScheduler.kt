/**
 * Schedules both background jobs as self-rescheduling one-time work requests anchored
 * to a specific time of day, rather than [androidx.work.PeriodicWorkRequest] — periodic
 * requests can't be pinned to a wall-clock time like "00:05" or "the user's chosen
 * time," only to an interval, and drift over repeated runs. Each worker re-enqueues
 * its own next run when it finishes — see [DailyVerseFetchWorker] and
 * [DailyVerseNotificationWorker].
 *
 * Deliberately WorkManager rather than exact alarms for both jobs: neither needs
 * to-the-minute precision (a devotional notification landing a few minutes late is
 * fine), and avoiding AlarmManager's exact-alarm APIs means no SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM
 * special permission, no user trip to system Settings to grant it, and none of the
 * extra Play Store policy scrutiny exact alarms attract.
